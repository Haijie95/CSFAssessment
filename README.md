# Encountered this when doing railway up

```
Error: TLS error: webpki error: UnsupportedCriticalExtension

Caused by:
    0: webpki error: UnsupportedCriticalExtension

Update!!!
Its outdated SSL Cert, updated my SSL certificate. 
However, it resulted to my credit in railway to become -$1.54.
Hence, unable to up to railway.
